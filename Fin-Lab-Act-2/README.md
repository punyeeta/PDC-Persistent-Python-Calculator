### Limpahan, Mark Vincent
1. Sequential execution consistently finished faster than parallel across both sorting and searching tasks, except for larger datasets where parallel sorting could be at advantage.
2. For sorting, the performance gap between sequential and parallel narrowed as dataset size grew. For searching, parallel never caught up regardless of dataset size, since linear search is too lightweight to justify the multiprocessing cost.
3. The main challenge was correctly computing the global index in parallel search, as each worker only knows its local position within its chunk, so the offset had to be added to return the correct position in the original dataset. For sorting, merging the sorted chunks back in the right order required careful handling.
4. Python's multiprocessing has significant startup overhead per process. For short tasks, this overhead dominates total runtime. The Queue in searching and the merge step in sorting both add synchronization cost that sequential execution simply doesn't have.
5. Parallelism showed its only clear benefit in sorting the large random dataset. It was unnecessary for searching entirely, and for small to medium datasets across both tasks, highlighting that parallelism is not always the right tool, problem size and task complexity also matter.
